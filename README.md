# ES6features

Create repo that can gulp-mocha with babel.

Write up a program of your choice in ES6. Whenever possible, use the ES6 versions of features. Specifically, I'd like to use at least one of each of the following

Arrow functions 2pts  yes

Classes 2pts  yes

Class with inheritance 2pts  yes

Template strings 2pts  yes

Default arguments 2pts   yes

Promises 2pts  yes

Extra feature of your choice  2pts  ?
    const used

Never defaulting to es5 features for the above 1pt  ?

For 2 points of extra credit implement an es6 generator.
